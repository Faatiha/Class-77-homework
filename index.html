     <H1>Project On Console</H1>
     <p>In this project, we will learn about Console and also about Visual Studio Code.</p>  
     <hr>
     <p> Lets start with Console. You write the console command in Javascript. The way to write it is: console.log("write something");. If you put a varisble in the parentheses, do not use the quotation marks. . If you want to view the code, then simply just open the final output of your project, then double click on your mouse and you will see and option inspect. Click on that, go to Console, then you will the the final result. Simple, right? </p>

     <br>
     <p> Now lets learn about Visual Studio Code. Once you have downloaded it, you should open it. Then, once you are in, simply click on the four squares on the left side. Then, install Live Server. Then, you go to the Welcome page, then click on New File. By this time, you should already have a folder open in your device. Opn that folder, then create files inside that include JS, HTML, and CSS. To be able to inspect in on google chrome, go to the extension settings for the Live Server, then, you will be able to see an option where you can change it from Safari to Google Chrome. </p>

     <p>Here are some examples of console.log. To be able to see it, use the instructions above for console.</p>
     <script>
         console.log("My first Console Project by");

         var firstname= "Faatiha";
         var lastname= "Aayat";

         var full_name= firstname.concat(lastname);
         console.log(full_name);

         console.log("This is 5 to the power 2.");

         var pow= Math.pow(5, 2);
         console.log(pow);

         console.log("Which one is the max, 25, or 52?");

         var max= Math.max(25, 52);
         console.log(max);

         console.log("Which is the minimum one, 24 or 42?");

         var min= Math.min(24, 42);
         console.log(min);
